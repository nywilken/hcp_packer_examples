# hcp_packer_examples
Repository of working examples using Packer, Terraform, and the HCP Packer registry


These examples have been tested in a controlled environment and are not garunteed to work without modification in other test environments. 
With that said, these examples are purely for testing purposes and should not be used for production. If you are interested in testing out 
these examples please feel free to pull down the repo and adjust the examples as you see fit.
